# Takeout Utils

I plan to have more here eventually.

# Google Search Activity Utility

A command-line utility to help you interact with your Google Drive and [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) activity data.

## Features

1. Copy and extract a file from Google Drive to your local machine.
2. List your activities from the `/My Activity/Search/MyActivity.html` file with various output options such as format, information type, and number of entries to display.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Conda

- Installed conda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/ 
- Installed required packages in a new env by running: `conda create -n llm --file package-list.txt` (by default this will install only the packages required for the `list-searches` subcommand no google drive functionality)

### Pip

- Installed pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
- Installed required packages. There is no package list for pip, so you will need to install the packages manually. The packages are listed in the `package-list.txt` file.
